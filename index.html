      by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon media
      franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
      Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and
      the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred as the

        <span>
          Water is one of the three basic elemental pok-types along with Fire and
          Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a
          simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
          Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based
          on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

          Fire is one of the three basic elemental pok-types along with Water and
          Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a
          simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
          Fire pok-types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so
          choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

          simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new
          players.Grass is one of the weakest pok-types statistically, with 5
          defensive weaknesses and 7 pok-types that are resistant to Grass moves.

        these stars can split metal in two.

  <section class="Q-A">
    <h2>Q and A</h2>
    <h4>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?
        <ul>
          <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is
            essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu,
            mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity.
            Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers
            should be able to answer.</li>
          <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?
        <ul>
          <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but
            progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who
            emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where
            you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button
            mashing at all is required.</li>
          <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

        <p>Pokémon Go's pok-Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon games, but the effect of those type
          matchups is slightly different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly different
          multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in line.

      <div>
        <h4>First Generation</h4>
        <p>(1996–1999)</p>
        <p>The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were
          created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red
          and Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released
          sometime after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The
          original Green version was not released outside Japan</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Second Generation</h4>
        <p>(1999–2002)</p>
        <p>The second generation of Pokémon video games began in 1999 with the Japanese release of Pokémon Gold and
          Silver for the Game Boy Color, with Australia and North America getting the game in October 2000 and European
          release date of April 2001. Like the previous generation, an enhanced version, titled Pokémon Crystal, was
          later released.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Third Generation</h4>
        <p>(2002–2006)</p>
        <p>Pokémon entered its third generation with the 2002 release of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire for Game Boy Advance
          and continued with the Game Boy Advance remakes of Pokémon Red and Green, Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen (Red
          and Green representing the original Japanese first generation games; territories outside Japan instead saw
          releases of Red and Blue). An enhanced remake of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire titled Pokémon Emerald followed
          after.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Four Generation</h4>
        <p>(2006–2010)</p>
        <p>In 2006, Japan began the fourth generation of the franchise with the release of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl for
          Nintendo DS. The games were released in North America on April 22, 2007 and in Australia on June 21, 2007. The
          game was released in the UK and Europe on July 27, 2007. Other main series games in the fourth generation
          include Pokémon Platinum, a director's cut version of Diamond and Pearl in the same vein as Pokémon Yellow,
          Crystal, and Emerald.It was released for the Nintendo DS in Japan on September 13, 2008, in North America on
          March 22, 2009, and in Australia and Europe on May 14, 2009 and May 22, 2009</p>
